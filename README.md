Intelligent Recommendation System for POIs
This project focuses on context-aware recommender systems (CARS) that actively integrate the user’s context into the recommendation process. It presents the details related to the design and development of a CARS intended for tourists. The goal is to build a software solution that assists them during their visits by recommending points of interest (POIs) that best match their preferences as well as their current context. Two context attributes were considered: the user’s current location and the current time.

This work led us to propose a personal categorization of POIs, a context-aware recommendation approach that combines three filters in order to take into account both user preferences and context, and finally, a client-server architecture for our system to be implemented.
